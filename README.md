SuperbaseEcommerce is the name of the app we'll be working on in this tutorial. It is simply an online ecommerce shopping site where users can browse all of the products, bookmark their favorite products, and even purchase the products. It is similar to an Amazon app, but it is simpler because we will not implement any actual payment or shipping procedures. Here's a live demonstration of the final version of the app. This is how your app should look after you finish this tutorial. Feel free to experiment with it to get a sense of all the features we will be implementing.

So, in this tutorial, we'll learn how to build this full-stack app with "Next.js," the react framework, "NextAuth.js," for implementing passwordless and OAuth authentication, Supabase, for persisting app data into a PostgreSQL database and stashing media files and information, and Prisma, for making it simple to read and write data from and to the database from our app.

This article tutorial covers many topics and technical concepts necessary to build a modern full-stack app, even if this app is a simplified version of a more advanced ecommerce site like Amazon. You should be able to use all of the technologies covered in this tutorial, including react, nextjs, prisma, supabase, and others, but most importantly, you should be able to build any full-stack app using those technologies. You'll go at your own speed and intensity, with us guiding you along the way. After completing this guide, the goal of this article is to provide you with the tools and techniques you'll need to build a similar app on your own.To put it another way, this tutorial will not only teach you how to use those technologies in great detail, but it will also provide you with the proper mixture of principles and application to help you grasp all of the key concepts so that you can proudly build your own apps from scratch later.
